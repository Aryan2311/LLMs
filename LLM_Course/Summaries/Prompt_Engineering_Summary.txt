In this course we got to know the basic structure of the openai.ChatCompletion function and how to effectively use it by passing the prompts to it.
We saw how we can use iterative statements to feed the model on multiple inputs at one go.
We saw how the model could be used to summarize a given text by the user.
We also go through an important characterstic of the LLM model how it can inferr the sentiment of the user.
We transformed the inputs and the outputs from one format to the other conveniently.
At last we successfully build an AI Chatbot to be used at a restaurant using LLM model.
