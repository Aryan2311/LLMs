We learned the core mechanism of diffusion models  that is the concept of "diffusing" information across multiple steps or iterations.
Each step involves applying a series of transformations to gradually refine the predicted distribution of the next token.
The process begins with an initial distribution.
These steps typically involve sampling from the current distribution, conditioning on the observed tokens, and applying a set of transformation functions.
The transformation functions act as "diffusion operators" that update the distribution by spreading and refining the information across the context.
